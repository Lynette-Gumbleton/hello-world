# hello-world
Hi! My name is Lynette. I work as an Epidemiologist Data Analyst at Wyoming Public Health Laboratories. We use R to understand the massive amounts of COVID data we have. I have joined GitHub to further hone my R skills to make me more effective at work. If you have suggestions, I would love to hear them. My e-mail is lynette.gumbleton@gmail.com
